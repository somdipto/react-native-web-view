## Architecture

### Key Components

- `App.jsx` - Main application component with split layout
- `CodeEditor.jsx` - Monaco editor wrapper with React Native syntax highlighting
- `SnackPreview.jsx` - Preview panel with mobile/web toggle
- `WorkingSnackPreview.jsx` - Expo Snack integration component
- `QRCodeGenerator.jsx` - QR code generation for mobile testing
- `useSnack.js` - Custom hook for Snack SDK integration

### Preview System

The application implements a robust preview system:

1. **Primary**: Expo Snack SDK integration for real-time React Native preview
2. **Fallback**: Demo Snack embed when SDK is not available
3. **Mobile Frame**: CSS-based mobile phone simulation
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry mechanisms

## Development Notes

### Expo Snack SDK Integration

The application integrates with Expo Snack SDK to provide real-time React Native preview. Due to authentication requirements for creating new Snacks, the current implementation uses a demo Snack for preview purposes. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Implement Expo authentication
2. Create new Snacks via the Expo API
3. Handle Snack lifecycle management

### Mobile Phone Simulation

The mobile preview includes a realistic phone frame with:
- Rounded corners and bezels
- Home indicator (iPhone-style)
- Proper aspect ratio
- Touch-friendly interface

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time code synchronization with Expo Snack
- [ ] Multiple file support and project structure
- [ ] Dependency management interface
- [ ] Export to Expo project
- [ ] Collaborative editing
- [ ] Code templates and examples
- [ ] Performance optimization
